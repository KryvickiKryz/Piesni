Pieśni
==========
A small collection of belarusian songs. I will add new ones here from time to time.
Some of the texts here you won't be able to find on the internet (only audio).
This is because I listened to these songs and wrote down the text.

There is two directories - "kirylica" and "lacinka". 
"Kirylica" - contains cyrillic versions of the songs.
While "Lacinka" - contains the latin versions of the songs.

I will add a small line at the start (a link to an example of how to sing the given song).
And a small note at the end of file with some notes from me. (All of the notes will be in belarusian).

!! I am not planning on writing down authors' names as I am too afraid to accidently miss.
So if you want to reasearch the authors  of the songs - do it yourself. 
I, again, will add a link to an example of how to sing a given song at the start of the file, so you may start there.

! I am a bit uncertain aboyt vajacki-marš, I may correct the text again in the future
